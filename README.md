## Guide

You find yourself within a cemetry of an ancient manor. You're a ghost. You can enter any room of the manor
but you're made of pure spirit. You will need a considerable quantity of extra help from the livings of the house if you want to reach your final goal.

You can possess almost any character of the map, and directly control their bodies : you must take advantage of their features, belongings and qualities to open a way to the final clash.

Remember you can also get advantage of your mighty scream that will shake every character and item.
